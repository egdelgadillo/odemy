## Usage

This project was done using **Angular 10**. Therefore it features all scripts that come out-of-the-box with Angular.

First we need to install all dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

You can start the development server by running npm's script:

```bash
npm start
```

or using Angular CLI:

```bash
ng serve
```

Then we open our browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/
